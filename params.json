{"name":"auto-ssh-tunnel","tagline":"Automatically create a Reverse SSH Tunnel !","body":"# **Overview**\r\n\r\nAutomatic SSH Tunnel is a Python script which can be used to create a Reverse SSH Tunnel between multiple computers running Linux and a centralized server.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- Automatically configures and runs openssh to set-up a reverse ssh connection during boot-up \r\n\r\n- Automatically generates ssh keys\r\n\r\n- No need to store the server's password\r\n\r\n- Works with Debian-based systems, including Ubuntu\r\n\r\n- 3-step configuration wizard that requires less than 1 minute to set-up  \r\n\r\n\r\n### System requirements\r\n\r\n- These instructions were tested on Ubuntu 15.10\r\n\r\n- The installation script automatically installs openssh-server with Apt  \r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n# **Getting started**  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nClone the latest repository version from Github (recommended):  \r\n`$ git clone https://github.com/facerecog/auto-ssh-tunnel.git`  \r\n\r\nAlternatively, download the .tar.gz  file from the top of this page and unpack it:  \r\n`$ wget ______ && tar xf ______`  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation \r\n\r\n1. Run  configuration.py  to specify the port, username, and IP address of the SSH server:\r\n`$ python configure.py <port> <username> <ip address>` \r\n\r\n2. Run the following command:  \r\n`$ sudo python setup.py install`  \r\n\r\n3. Enter the server’s `<username>@<ipaddress>` as prompted  \r\n\r\n4. You will be prompted for a passphrase. Give a **blank** passphrase.  \r\n\r\nThe installation will proceed automatically. If successful, the output of all the commands should roughly show:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReading package lists...

Restart the client to complete the installation. To run autossh, input connect.py on the terminal.\r\n```  \r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n# **How the script works**  \r\n\r\nDuring installation, the script will automatically add the following lines to /etc/ssh/ssh_config:\r\n```\r\nServerAliveInterval 30\r\nServerAliveCountMax 4\r\nClientAliveInterval 30\r\nClientAliveCountMax 4\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon boot, the client will run `connect.py`, which sets up a reverse ssh tunnel. The server may now ssh into the client even if the client resides behind a NAT firewall.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n# **Verify that it works**  \r\n\r\n* From the client, ssh into your server:  \r\n`$ ssh <rootname>@<ip address>`  \r\n\r\n* Once in, connect back to your client:  \r\n`$ ssh <your username>@localhost -p <port number specified as above>`\r\n\r\n* If successful, you have just ssh-ed back into your client. Congratulations and enjoy!\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Uninstall**  \r\n\r\nTo uninstall:  \r\n`$ rm -rf /etc/init.d/connect.py /etc/auto-ssh-tunnel /usr/local/bin/connect.py`  \r\n-------------------------\r\n  \r\n\r\n# **Screenshots**  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n# **Support**  \r\n\r\nIf you want to support this project, please consider reaching out to me:\r\n\r\nEmail: muhd.amrullah@facerecog.asia  \r\n\r\n\r\nProperty of Facerecog Asia Pte.
